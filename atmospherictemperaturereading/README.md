My approach to solve this problem was to create 8 threads that read the temperature every minute. I also created a thread that creates the document needed to store. I was able to circumnvent using any types of locks as I created a 2D matrix that holds an index for each potential reading. The use of locks could potentially slow down the program exponentially so not having locks saves a lot of run time. Additionally, having a seperate thread that creates the document allows the temperature reading threads to remain free at all times and in a concurrent system this allows them to be running at all times. This is effectively the most efficient approach.
