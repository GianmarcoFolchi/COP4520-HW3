For this problem, I created my own implementation of a concurrent linked list. This was a challenging endeavor, but I decided that having a lock for each node would circumnvent having to lock the entire linked list which would make this program extremely slow. One implementation detail is that I decided to lock the nodes in ascending order tu prevent deadlock from happening. Every worker will pull from the tail of the linked list as that is the node that will most likely not be locked effectively making the program faster. Additionally, I added locking mechanisms to be able to find if a specific node is in the linked list.
